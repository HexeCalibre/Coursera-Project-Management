## Helpful habits to successfully complete the certificate
As a learner, you’re bringing all of your past experiences and best learning practices to this program. The designers of this course have also put together a list of helpful habits that they believe will help you to be successful: 

1. Plan your time: Setting regular study times and sticking with them each week can help you make learning a part of your routine. Use a calendar or timetable to create a schedule, and list what you plan to do each day in order to break your work down into achievable goals. Create a quiet place to watch the videos, review the readings, and complete the activities so you can really focus on the material.

2. Be curious: If you find an idea that gets you excited, act on it! Ask questions, search for more details online, check out the links that interest you, and take notes on your discoveries. The little things you do to support your learning along the way will take your knowledge even further, open more doors in this high-growth field, and help you qualify for jobs. 

3. Take notes: Notes are useful-to-remember information that you think might be important in the future, especially as you’re preparing to enter a new job field. In addition, taking notes is an effective way to make connections between topics and gain a better understanding of those topics.

4. Build your career identity: Your career identity is the unique value you bring to the workforce. [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xbT4qMrot4) to learn about the key components of career identity and write your own career identity statement.

## Finding more information
Throughout this course, you will learn the basics of project management. We will provide a lot of information through videos and readings. But sometimes, you may need to look things up on your own for additional learning. Things change fast in this growing field, so it is critical to do your own research so you can stay up-to-date on what is new. 

Here are some helpful project management resources available online:

- The [Project Management Institute](https://www.pmi.org/) is the leading association for those in project, program, or portfolio management professions. Their website provides guides, industry standards, articles, templates, job boards, certifications, and more to help support professionals in these careers.

- The [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/index.html) defines Scrum, a technique used in Agile project management. You’ll learn about this framework later in the program. This guide describes Scrum’s roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together. You can also find hundreds of free resources to learn more about Scrum at [Scrum.org Resources](https://www.scrum.org/resources).
