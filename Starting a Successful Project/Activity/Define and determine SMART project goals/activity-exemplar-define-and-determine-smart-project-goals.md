## Assessment of Exemplar
Compare the exemplar to your completed SMART goals activity. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

> ***Note:** Your SMART goals may differ from the exemplar in some ways. That’s okay—what’s important is that your goals meet as many of the SMART criteria as possible.*

Let’s review each SMART goal:

### SMART goal one
The original goal indicates that Office Green will boost its overall brand awareness through Plant Pals, but it doesn’t indicate how they will do it, whether it's possible, why it’s important, or when they will get it done. The SMART goal addresses all these questions, which increases Office Green’s chances of reaching their aim:

*“Office Green will boost brand awareness with a new marketing and sales strategy and website update that will increase page views by 2K per month by the end of the year.”*

- **Specific**: Office Green will update their website and launch a new marketing and sales strategy to boost awareness of their brand.

- **Measurable**: The goal includes a metric of 2K new page views per month.

- **Attainable**: They have a year to reach this goal and the target of 2K new page views per month is in line with prior marketing campaigns.

- **Relevant**: Greater brand awareness can mean new customers, which supports the overall project goal of a 5% revenue increase.

- **Time-bound**: The deadline is at the end of the year.

### SMART goal two
The original goal indicates that Office Green will raise their customer retention rate, but it doesn’t indicate how they will do it, whether it's possible, why it’s important, or when they will get it done. The SMART goal addresses all these questions, which increases Office Green’s chances of reaching their aim:

*“Office Green will raise their overall customer retention rate by 10% by the end of the year by implementing a new Operations & Training plan for the Plant Pals service.”*

- **Specific**: Office Green will implement an Operations & Training plan that will improve on existing customer service standards and boost efficiency. 

- **Measurable**: The goal includes a metric of a 10% increase in retention. 

- **Attainable**: They have a year to reach this goal and many former and existing customers are interested in the new service. It has the potential to help them keep customers who may be thinking about leaving for a landscaper with more services.

- **Relevant**: Increasing customer retention can lead to more sales, which supports the overall project goal of a 5% revenue increase.

- **Time-bound**: The deadline is at the end of the year.
